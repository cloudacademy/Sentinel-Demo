# Common-Functions

These common functions created by rberlind are a set of functions that speed up Sentinel policy writing. Additionally, they bring the barrier of entry to writing Sentinel policies down for the common lay-person. 

It is my belief that these functions should ship standard with the Sentinel framework as a standard import.
